## ✅ What is an AI Agent?

An **AI agent** is a system that:

> **Perceives its environment, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve a goal.**

In the context of modern GenAI:

> An AI agent is an LLM-powered system that can reason, plan, and use tools autonomously to complete tasks.

## 🔹 Classic Definition (Theoretical AI)

An agent has:

1️⃣ **Perception** – Receives input (text, data, signals)
2️⃣ **Decision-making** – Chooses what to do
3️⃣ **Action** – Produces output or interacts with environment

This is the traditional AI definition from agent-based systems.

## 🔹 Modern LLM-Based Agent

Today, an AI agent usually consists of:

* 🧠 **LLM (Reasoning Engine)**
* 🛠 **Tools (APIs, DBs, search, calculators)**
* 🗂 **Memory (short-term / long-term)**
* 🔁 **Execution Loop (Think → Act → Observe)**

## 🔹 Simple Example

User:

> Find the latest stock price of Tesla and summarize recent news.

A simple LLM:

* Might hallucinate.

An AI Agent:

1. Calls stock API
2. Calls news API
3. Retrieves data
4. Summarizes results
5. Returns grounded answer

## 🔹 Agent vs LLM

| LLM            | AI Agent        |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| Generates text | Makes decisions |
| No tool usage  | Uses tools      |
| Single-step    | Multi-step      |
| Passive        | Goal-driven     |

---

## 🔹 Core Properties of an AI Agent

✔ Goal-oriented
✔ Autonomous (to some degree)
✔ Interactive with environment
✔ Adaptive
✔ Can maintain state

---

## 🔹 Types of AI Agents (Classical AI)

1. Simple Reflex Agents
2. Model-Based Agents
3. Goal-Based Agents
4. Utility-Based Agents
5. Learning Agents

(Interviewers sometimes like this theoretical angle.)

## 🔹 Real-World Uses

* AI coding copilots
* Workflow automation bots
* Customer support agents
* Autonomous research assistants
* Multi-agent systems

## 🎯 30-Second Interview Answer

> An AI agent is a system that perceives inputs, makes decisions, and takes actions to achieve a goal. In modern AI systems, an agent is typically an LLM-powered system that can reason, use tools, maintain memory, and operate in a loop to complete multi-step tasks autonomously.

---


> Unlike a standalone LLM, an AI agent operates in a feedback loop — it reasons about a task, selects actions, observes results, and refines its strategy until the goal is achieved.
